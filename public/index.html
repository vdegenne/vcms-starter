    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>If you see this page, it means your app is up and running. Good job.</p>
    <p>Right now your application has only one route : <a title="try me" href="/api/example/hello" target="_blank">/api/example/hello</a>.
      <br>Routes are not in the public space, they are just server responses from specific urls.</p>
    <p>But this page you reading right now is in the public directory of your application.</p>
    <p>You can remove or edit this page to your own likings. Or use the script <code>yarn attach-polymer</code> to call a Polymer starter. Polymer lets you make wonderful things on the front-end spotlight. After attaching a polymer starter, refresh this page and you should see a new welcoming message.</p>
